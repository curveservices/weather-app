## Overview

[Project weather app](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app) has been set as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). After learning async/await, promises & thenables and APIs. I was able to search for a specific location and toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius.
I was able change the look of the page based on the data. This project took me 3 days to complete.

## Assets

- [weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

## Obejective

1. Write the functions that hit the API. Youâ€™re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information.
2. Write the functions that process the JSON data youâ€™re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
3. Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).
4. Display the information on your webpage!
5. Add styling

## Extra

- Optional: add a â€˜loadingâ€™ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API. Use DevTools to test for low-end devices.
